# Future Tasks:
- Allow users to type in the name of the company instead of an EIN value.
- Provide a deeper analysis and more insights/comparisons of the graphs.
- Improve the UI.
- Comparison within States charts are a bottleneck. Requires optimization. Maybe cache the information so as not to retrieve the same static info.
- Utilize a GDP Per Capita API to provide a live comparison for the States charts.
